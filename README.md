# WordlUtils

Python script I use for [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) related utilities.
Also WIP for Nerdle.


Right now can be used to:
- show every word that could be the solution (only Wordle)
- track/save to (default) `data/wordles.csv` the played Wordle, and `data/nerdles.csv` for Nerdle
- small stats for the tracked games
